# Justifications

##  Why Django
* Django is one of the most used frameworks for Webdevelopment, alongside with Flask. Unfortunately I never used Flask. 

* Django provides a sceletton website which fits most needs of the requirements

* Together with Bootstrap one can build pretty Websites

* Currently I am working on a Website for my current employer in Django

## General 
* I decided to implement a View so there is no need to login, task could also be done by implementing only admin site

* Production was not required, therefore everything stays in DEBUG mode
